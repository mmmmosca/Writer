# Writer

The cypher.py file asks you input, then it spits you out something like this:

[.+%([.+%([.+%(};,!][.+%([.+%(
[36.0, 101, 54.0, 54.0, 55.5, 16.0, 29.0, 41]

To convert it back to text, all you need is that series of numbers under the gibberish.
Then, open the decypher.py and follow the instructions.
